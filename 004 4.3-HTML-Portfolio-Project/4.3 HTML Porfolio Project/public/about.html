<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Shanik Islam Apon. A textile Engieer with a degree of Bachelor in Textile engineering 
  currently persued my Masters in business administration in Apparel merchandising. The goal
  is to become a Computer Engineer.
</p>

<p>Doing Projects Learing codes and other things to go foroward. Theres a lot of issues that
  messing around me, distract me from my work making it complicated I don't know am i gonna 
  finish the path or not that i've made. I think following the likings about what you love to
  do most is the only thing we all need to do in life and have work with that.
</p>

<p>I hope i'll find the righ path that i'm looking for. Being a another background is 
  not a complicated thing. But keeping self motivated is important in this case.
